BBQ Automated Temperature Controller using Raspberry Pi and PitOPS Practices

The goal of this project is to marry the Devops philosophies, spirit and practices with the art of making great BBQ in order to produce a much more consistant and quality finished product each and every time.  

The Problem:
===========

We've all been there before.  You've invited a bunch of people over for dinner.  You've bought your meat and ingredients.  You have a lot of things to do that day, sons football game, trip to the store, pickup daughter from the mall, mow the lawn and most of all you need to get the house nice and cleaned up ready for guests.  The issue is you need to get the BBQ pit fired up early, so you can get it dialed into the right temperature.  Then you have to get your meat on there and get the pit temperature leveled back out to the right temps once again.  Once the meats on the grill, you start your all day job of tending the fire.  Every 15 minutes you need to make sure its stable at the desired temp, a full day of messing with air vents and dealing with hot and cold spells on the pit.  You can't just take off and do the things you need to today, you are officially on PitOps.  Your significant other now has to pick up the slack on everthing else or you risk the chances of burnt BBQ if you try to slip off for more than a few minutes.  That's a bad start to the day for everyone.  You need better PitOps.

PitOps:
===========

By (loosely) leveraging DEVOPS "CAMS" principals we can add much more efficiency, automation and ultimately change the culture around BBQ in every household.  

Culture:  Starting with culture.  The process of BBQ is very labor entensive and manual.  It is very high touch throughout the whole process and everyone's turns out different.  Its viewed as a very artistic process where the pitmaster puts his heart and soul into the process to produce a peice of meat with his very essence in it.  This sounds a lot like the same artisan Ops/Devs who roll thier code into production on beautifully hand crafted servers that have been chiseled to perfection right there on the spot in live production.  One of a kind, artisan servers with the essence of each individual engineer who touched it last, while may sound romantic on the surface we all know is a terrible idea.  I think we can change the BBQ culture to see the craft and artistry of the process should be focused on the meat itself, ingredients, spice rubs, marindates, (Source Code if you will) and NOT the cooking pipeline itself.
